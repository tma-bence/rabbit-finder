This repository is all about the rabbit-hole problems solution.
I am not sure if it is the original name for the problem, but it will work for now.

> What is the **rabbit-hole** problem?

> There are 100 holes in the ground next to each other. In one of the holes there is a rabbit.
> Your task is to find the rabbit, by guessing the number of the whole in which you think they are.
> A guess goes as follows:
> - if you guess **right**, you won
> - if you guess **wrong**, the rabbit jumps to one of the holes next to the one they are currently in
> For example:
> You guessed hole number 15, but the rabbit was in number 5. Now the rabbit jumps to either number 4 or number 6.
