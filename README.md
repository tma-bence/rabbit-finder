This repository is all about the rabbit-hole problem's solution.
I'm not sure if it is the original name for the problem, but it will work for now.

## What is the **rabbit-hole** problem? ##

There are 100 holes in the ground next to each other. In one of the holes there is a rabbit.
Your task is to find the rabbit, by guessing the number of the hole in which you think they are.

> A guess goes as follows:
> - if you guess the **right** number, you won 🏆
> - if you guess the **wrong** number, the rabbit jumps to one of the holes next to the one they are currently in
>    - the rabbit can't jump from hole number *100* to *1* and vice versa
>    - the rabbit can't stay in the same hole
>    - the rabbit can jump back and forth (from number *5* to number *6* and then back to number *5*)

> For example:
> You guessed hole number *15*, but the rabbit was in number *5*. Now the rabbit jumps to either number *4* or number *6*.

Good luck! 😉
